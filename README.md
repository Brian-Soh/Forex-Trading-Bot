# Forex Trading Bot

In this project I explored the intersection of quantitative finance and software development. I created a framework for a forex trading bot using Interactive Brokers' (IBKR) Python API to stream real time market data and execute orders on a simulated trading account though both their Trader Work Station (TWS) and their headless application, IB Gateway. I also tested the perpetuality of the trading bot by deploying it headlessly on an Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2).
