# Forex Trading Bot

In this project I explored the intersection of quantitative finance and software development. I created a framework for a forex trading bot using [Interactive Brokers' (IB) Python API](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#api-introduction) to stream real time market data and execute orders on a simulated trading account though both their Trader Work Station (TWS) and their headless application, IB Gateway. I also tested the perpetuality of the trading bot by deploying it headlessly on an Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). The IB Gateway application has many requirements, such as a GUI interface for login and hosting, as well as a daiy reboot. To automatically handle these prerequisites, I created a shell script which creates a X Virtual Frame Buffer to simulate an interface and leverages the [Interactive Brokers Controller (IBC)](https://github.com/IbcAlpha/IBC?tab=readme-ov-file) utility to fill in my credentials. After that, I configured a cron job run the script daily.
